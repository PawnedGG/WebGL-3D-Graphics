# WebGL-3D-Graphics

Inside the folder there are pictures used for adding texture to our objects,
Web-GL libraries for running code,
and one HTML file used to display our object on a web browser.

Depicting images from a local file in a web browser is not allowed by default, so we use Mozzila Firefox 
with the flag "security.fileuri.strict_origin_policy" disabled.
To do this you have to type "about:config" and on preferences put above flag and set it to false.
